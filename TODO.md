# TODO
* make String work with just String.new if newWithStr isn't found

# TODO (genetic algorithm)
* make able to re-place obstacles (actually reallocate memory and stuff)
* random acceleration vector should not actually be random, it slightly modifies current by +-1
* should acceleration vectors mutate in consecutive pairs as it is or individually?
* determine optimal dynamicMutationRate constant (current is 1530)
* BFS constants
* take into account steps dot hasn't reach goal, ie 100 steps to reach 100 fitness is better than 150 steps to reach 105 fitness

# TODO (for later)
* breakpoints
* nand in nand
* lisp interpreter
* barrel shifter
* mouse input and click input (use RAM 24767 to avoid breaking backwards incompatibility)
