# NAND

NAND, or **N**ot **A** **N**and-powered **D**evice, is an emulated full stack computer architecture. Based on the Jack-VM-Hack platform specified in [The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=ed_oe_p), NAND is a learning project for me to understand how computers work.
