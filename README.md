# NAND

NAND is my attempt at emulating an entire computer in TypeScript, both its software and hardware components.

Based on the theoretical structure of the Jack-VM-Hack platform specified in [The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=ed_oe_p), NAND is intended to be my own learning project to gain a level of intimate understanding of computer architecture ummatched by mere reading alone. Therefore, I am challenging myself to refrain from referencing external sources in building this project and will instead only rely on the book's guidance and my own intuition.
